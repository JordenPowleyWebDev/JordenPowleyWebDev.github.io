                <p class="medium_text white_text">I'm Jorden a web developer based in the Midlands.</p>
                <p class="medium_text white_text">After graduating Keele University in 2016 with a Bachelor's Degree in BSc Computer Science, I've spent the last 2 years working for Zonal Retail Data Systems within marketing technologies. I have acquired time management skills, as well as the ability to communicate between different product teams and clients while effectively meeting milestones and deadlines.</p>
                <p class="medium_text white_text">Whilst my degree was Java based, including my dissertation, my current speciality is within PHP systems, particularly using the Codeigniter MVC framework. In most cases my skills have been used to build new products that compliment the existing Zonal systems.</p>
                <p class="medium_text white_text">Outside of work I can usually be found running and doing free weights at home. Like every other developer I have a million self-projects on the go. One day I may finish one of them... Currently going through a Magic: The Gathering phase, it's doing well to keep myself from staring at various screens all the time. At the weekend I usually go out for a few craft beers and pretend I know what I'm talking about when I drink them, pretty much like everyone else.</p>
                <p class="medium_text white_text">I'm always looking for extra projects on the side that interest me. If you have anything in mind feel free to contact me.</p>
